# Gun Violence Analysis in the United States (2013-2018)

## Overview
This project analyzes gun violence data within the United States from January 2013 to March 2018. To provide a broader context, we merge this data with state-level economic and demographic data from 2008 to 2021. By combining these datasets, we aim to explore potential correlations between economic or demographic indicators and the locations and frequency of gun violence incidents.

The primary focus areas of this analysis are:
- Insights into the impacts of mass shootings.
- Geographic patterns of mass shootings across the United States.
- Characteristics of individuals involved in these incidents.

## Methodology
The project utilizes a combination of statistical techniques and data visualization in R to extract meaningful insights:

- **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Used to estimate probabilities and analyze the uncertainty in trends related to gun violence.
- **Bootstrapping**: Applied to generate confidence intervals and validate findings derived from the data.
- **Data Visualization**: Leveraging `ggplot2` and other R packages to create intuitive visual representations of the data.

## Goals
By integrating gun violence data with economic and demographic indicators, we aim to:
1. Identify any significant correlations or patterns.
2. Gain deeper insights into the socioeconomic factors influencing gun violence.
3. Inform potential policy or societal interventions to reduce gun violence in the United States.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Language**: R
- **Key Libraries**: `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `tidyr`

## Next Steps
Further exploration and refinement of the analysis will include:
1. Assessing the robustness of findings using additional datasets.
2. Incorporating temporal trends in economic and demographic data.
3. Enhancing the visualizations for better communication of insights.
